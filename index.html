            <h1>Rules</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p> -football is a 11 a side game where the teams can make 3 substitutions(substitute one player for another who did not start the game) whenever they want to during the game.
                <br>
                -There will be one referee officiating the main game, a referee to see offsides or help referee with close throw in’s/corners. Another referee helping out VAR which checks the referees decisions. 
                <br>
                -A game of football lasts for 90 minutes and is divided into two halves of 45 with a break after one half. There will be added time after 45 minutes in added time to make up for time that may have been lost time(checks, injuries etc)
                <br>
                -Each team has to try and score a goal into the opposition goal. The team with the most goals at the end of the game will win
                <br>
                -For winning, if it’s a league format you will get 3 points, you will get 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss
                <br>
                -In a tournament format, if you win you will go through to the next stage of the tournament and if you lose you will get knocked out. In case of a tie in knockout tournament matches, 30 minutes of extra time will be allocated with 15 minute halves(plus added time). If it’s still a tie after extra time, the winner will be decided by penalties, where each team has to take penalties with different players in the team and whoever makes more in 5 penalties wins. If it’s a tie in the 5 penalties, it will go to sudden death where the team that scores and saves a penalty kick first wins. 
                <br>
                -In some tournaments, extra time is skipped and the game would go straight to penalties 
                <br>
                -Each team will have 1 goalkeeper, defenders, midfielder and attackers. The team and the number of players in each area of the field will be decided by the coaching staff of the team. 
                <br>
                -If the ball goes out of play in one of the sides then a throw in will be awarded to the team that didn’t have the last touch before the ball went out of play. A team will be awarded a corner(cross from the corner line) if the ball goes behind the opposition goal and the one of the opposition players kicked/deflected it out. 
                <br>
                -Fouls in the sport include- kicking a player without getting the ball, touching the ball with your hands(only for outfield players), pushing a player down, inappropriate celebrations, high boot
                <br>
                -For a foul the referee can either give the player/players committing the foul a warning, a yellow card or a red card. A warning is the referee alerting the player, a yellow card is a booking for the player and two yellow cards mean a red card to a player which means that the player won’t be allowed to continue, the team won’t be able to replace him/her either and will be reduced to 10 players. The player getting a red card could also be suspended for more games. A player can get a red card directly if they put in a very dangerous foul. The opposition team will also be given a free kick where they can take a shot pass without being under pressure from where the foul happened. Or if the foul is inside the 30 years circle where the goal is, the opposition will get a penalty. 1 on 1 kick against the goalkeeper. 
                <br>
                -The offside rule is a rule that can rule out goals or attacks. If the player who receives the ball is ahead of the last line of defence(deepest player), play will be stopped and the opposition will get a free kick from where the offsides happened. It is allowed to run ahead of the defense when the pass towards you is released.</p>
